        <p>Trail running’s fiercest rivalry took another twist this week after <strong>Jeffrey</strong> used Strava to unveil his new betting website, <a href="https://jeffrey9jeff.github.io/TrailBets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrailBets</a> — and immediately fired a shot at long-time rival <strong>Gus</strong>.</p>
        <p>The site lists Jeffrey the <strong>$1.72 favourite</strong> for this weekend’s <em>Lonely Mountain Ultra 50km</em>, with Gus the narrow outsider at <strong>$1.92</strong>. Predicted finish times on the site suggest Jeffrey will clock <strong>5:07:34</strong>, five minutes clear of Gus’s projected <strong>5:12:11</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote class="jeff">“The numbers don’t lie. Five minutes clear. Lonely Mountain is mine.” — Jeffrey</blockquote>
        <p>When approached for comment, Gus lived up to his reputation as the sport’s humble role model. Rather than bite back, he praised his rival’s entrepreneurial move:</p>
        <blockquote class="gus">“Jeffrey’s always thinking big—it’s great to see trail running showcased in new ways. The predicted times look fair enough, and it should be a brilliant race.” — Gus</blockquote>
        <p>Then, in classic Gus fashion, he added with a grin:</p>
        <blockquote class="gus">“I have to admit, I like the odds boost on Mitch’s predicted time. He’s been training hard and deserves a bit of the spotlight too.” — Gus</blockquote>
        <p>With the launch of <a href="https://jeffrey9jeff.github.io/TrailBets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrailBets</a> adding fuel to the fire, Saturday’s race is shaping into more than just a test of endurance—it’s a battle of pride, personality, and now, the punters’ wallets.</p>
